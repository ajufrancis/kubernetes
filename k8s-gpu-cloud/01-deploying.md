# Deploying the cluster
## Boostrap

As usual start with the bootstrap sequence. Just be careful that p2 instances are only available in us-west-2, us-east-1 and eu-west-2 as well as the us-gov regions. I have experience issues running p2 instances on the EU side hence I recommend using a US region. 

```
juju bootstrap aws/us-east-1 --credential canonical --constraints "cores=4 mem=16G root-disk=64G" 
# Creating Juju controller "aws-us-east-1" on aws/us-east-1
# Looking for packaged Juju agent version 2.1-rc1 for amd64

```

## Deploying instances

Once the controller is ready we can start deploying services. In my previous posts, I used "bundles" which are shortcuts to deploy complex apps. You can find some bundles in the repo you copied (named k8s-aws.yaml or equivalent) but this time we will deploy manually, to go through the mechanics of Juju when deploying applications. 

Kubernetes is made of 5 individual applications: Master, Worker, Flannel (network), etcd (cluster state storage DB) and easyRSA (PKI to encrypt communication and provide x509 certs). In the juju vocabulary, each app is modeled by a charm, which is a recipe of how to deploy an app. 

At deployment time, you can give constraints to Juju, either very specific (instance type) or laxist (# of cores). With the later, Juju will elect the cheapest instance matching your constraints on the target cloud. 

First thing is to deploy the applications: 

```
juju deploy cs:~containers/kubernetes-master-11 --constraints "cores=4 mem=8G root-disk=32G"
# Located charm "cs:~containers/kubernetes-master-11".
# Deploying charm "cs:~containers/kubernetes-master-11".
juju deploy cs:~containers/etcd-23 --to 0
# Located charm "cs:~containers/etcd-23".
# Deploying charm "cs:~containers/etcd-23".
juju deploy cs:~containers/easyrsa-6 --to lxd:0
# Located charm "cs:~containers/easyrsa-6".
# Deploying charm "cs:~containers/easyrsa-6".
juju deploy cs:~containers/flannel-10
# Located charm "cs:~containers/flannel-10".
# Deploying charm "cs:~containers/flannel-10".
juju deploy cs:~containers/kubernetes-worker-13 --constraints "instance-type=p2.xlarge" kubernetes-worker-gpu
# Located charm "cs:~containers/kubernetes-worker-13".
# Deploying charm "cs:~containers/kubernetes-worker-13".
juju deploy cs:~containers/kubernetes-worker-13 --constraints "instance-type=p2.8xlarge" kubernetes-worker-gpu8
# Located charm "cs:~containers/kubernetes-worker-13".
# Deploying charm "cs:~containers/kubernetes-worker-13".
juju deploy cs:~containers/kubernetes-worker-13 --constraints "instance-type=m4.2xlarge" -n3 kubernetes-worker-cpu
# Located charm "cs:~containers/kubernetes-worker-13".
# Deploying charm "cs:~containers/kubernetes-worker-13".
```

Here you can see an interesting property in Juju that we never approached before: naming the services you deploy. We deployed the same kubernetes-worker charm twice, but twice with GPUs and the other without. This gives us a way to group instances of a certain type, at the cost of duplicating some commands. 


## Adding the relations & Exposing software

Now that the applications are deployed, we need to tell Juju how they are related together. For example, the Kubernetes master needs certificates to secure its API. Therefore, there is a relation between the kubernetes-master:certificates and easyrsa:client. 

This relation means that once the 2 applications will be connected, some scripts will run to query the EasyRSA API to create the required certificates, then copy them in the right location on the k8s master. 

These relations then create statuses in the cluster, to which charms can react. 

Essentially, very high level, think Juju's objective as a pub-sub implementation of application deployment. Every action inside or outside of the cluster posts a message to a common bus, and charms can react to these and perform additional actions. 

Let's add the relations: 

```
juju add-relation kubernetes-master:certificates easyrsa:client
juju add-relation etcd:certificates easyrsa:client
juju add-relation kubernetes-master:etcd etcd:db
juju add-relation flannel:etcd etcd:db
juju add-relation flannel:cni kubernetes-master:cni

for TYPE in cpu gpu gpu8
do 
  juju add-relation kubernetes-worker-${TYPE}:kube-api-endpoint kubernetes-master:kube-api-endpoint
  juju add-relation kubernetes-master:cluster-dns kubernetes-worker-${TYPE}:kube-dns
  juju add-relation kubernetes-worker-${TYPE}:certificates easyrsa:client
  juju add-relation flannel:cni kubernetes-worker-${TYPE}:cni
  juju expose kubernetes-worker-${TYPE}
done 

juju expose kubernetes-master
```

Note at the end the "expose" commands. These are instructions for Juju to open up firewall in the cloud for specific ports of the instances. Some are predefined (Kubernetes Master API is 6443, Workers open up 80 and 443 for ingresses) but you can also force them if you need (for example, when you manually add stuff in the instances post deployment)

## Adding CUDA

CUDA does not have an official charm yet (coming up very soon!!), but there is my demoware implementation which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/SaMnCo/layer-nvidia-cuda)

Make sure you have the charm tools available, clone and build the CUDA charm: 

```
sudo apt install charm charm-tools

# Exporting the ENV
mkdir -p ~/charms ~/charms/layers ~/charms/interfaces
export JUJU_REPOSITORY=${HOME}/charms
export LAYER_PATH=${JUJU_REPOSITORY}/layers
export INTERFACE_PATH=${JUJU_REPOSITORY}/interfaces

# Build the charm
cd ${LAYER_PATH}
git clone https://github.com/SaMnCo/layer-nvidia-cuda cuda
charm build cuda
```

This will create a new folder called **builds** JUJU_REPOSITORY, and another called **cuda** in there. 

Now you can deploy the charm 

```
juju deploy --series xenial $HOME/charms/builds/cuda
juju add-relation cuda kubernetes-worker-gpu
juju add-relation cuda kubernetes-worker-gpu8
```

This will take a fair amount of time as CUDA is very long to install (CDK takes about 10min and just CUDA probably 15min). 

Nevertheless, at the end the status should show: 

```

So yes!! We have our 8 local GPUs as expected!!
