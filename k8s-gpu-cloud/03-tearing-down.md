Whenever you feel like it, you can tear down this demo. These instances can be pricey, hence powering them down when you do not use them is good. 

```
juju kill-controller aws/us-east-1
```

This will ask for confirmation then destroy everything... But now, you are just a few commands away from rebuilding it!
