# Conclusion

In the first part of this multi section post, we have automated the setup of a GPU enabled Kubernetes cluster in AWS. 

If you are a data scientist or running Kubernetes workloads that could benefit of GPUs, this already gives you an elegant and very fast way of managing your setups. But usually in this context, you also need to have storage available between the instances, whether it is to share the dataset or to exchange results. 

Kubernetes offers many options to connect storage. In the second part of the blog, we will see how to automate adding EFS storage to our instances, then put it to good use with some datasets! 

In the meantime, feel free to contact me if you have a specific use case in the cloud for this to discuss operational details. I would be happy to help you setup you own GPU cluster and get you started for the science!
